# SX1509_Daisy_Seed

The SX1509 16 Output I/O Expander Breakout Board greatly simplifies prototyping with the SX1509 chip, allowing you to easily add more I/O lines to an Arduino or any microcontroller with limited I/O. It communicates via an I2C interface and provides an additional 16 GPIO channels. It also features a fully programmable LED driver and a built-in keypad scanning engine capable of continuously polling up to 64 keys. Since the I/O banks can operate at voltages between 1.2V and 3.6V (with 5.5V tolerant inputs) independently from each other and from the core supply, the SX1509 can also act as a level shifter.

Key features:

16 channels of bidirectional I/O: built-in pull-up/pull-down resistors, programmable push-pull or open-drain outputs, programmable polarity.
Inputs tolerant up to 5.5V (operating voltage from 1.2V to 3.6V).
LED driver: PWM control and blinking mode available on all pins, breathing effect supported on selected pins.
Level shifting capability: independent supply rails for I/O (VCC1, VCC2) allow up or down level shifting.
Keypad scanning engine: supports up to 64 keys in an 8x8 matrix configuration.
